description: Pause the script for a specified time
empty_time: The time to pause is empty.  How much to pause the script?
time: >
    The time in seconds to pause the script for.  The script will resume
    after the specified time.  You can specify a number of seconds
    (like 3, which will pause the script for 3 seconds) or a floating-point
    number (like 0.5 to pause the script for half a second).  You can
    also specify a range between two numbers using the .. as a separator,
    like 1..2, which will pause the script between 1 and 2 seconds
    (the number will be chosen at random).
